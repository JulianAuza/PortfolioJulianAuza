                        <p> I am passionate about crafting seamless digital experiences. My background in UX has given me the
                            ability to solve problems effeciently through research and design. I have recently discovered
                            my affinity for development which inspired me to complete the full stack development programs
                            at Coding Dojo. I am currently looking forward to new opportunities that will allow me to learn
                            new skills and challenge my abilities.</p>

                <p>
                    This project focuses on the user interface design of an eCommerce platform carrying a variety of different products. The
                    main goal of the project is to create an interface that increases the total number of conversions in
                    the site. My client gave me limited resources and a short amount of time for this project which allowed
                    me to test my own ability to work quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="projectNote"> Research and Planning</h3>
                <p>I carried out a competitive and heuristic analysis to gain an understanding of the different mental models
                    present in different types of users of eCommerce platforms. Going through different sites, I noticed
                    that they all had their own efficient way of organizing their information tailored to their user's mental
                    model.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="projectNote">Persona Creation</h3>

                <p>To gather information regarding the mental model of the target users I carried out surveys and interviews that uncover user's 
                    preferences, attitudes, and feelings towards certain features, events, and situations. The surveys consisted of questions 
                    that rated the the user's reactions and attitudes towards certain features and interactions. The interview questions consisted 
                    of open ended questions to dig deeper into the users mental model and uncover potential areas for innovation. I used the 
                    information derived from surveys and interviews to create three personas that embodied three main user goals that my design will
                    revolve around.</p><br>

                    accessible through the appropriate navigation. of wire frames that I occasionally test with my peers to ensure a cohesive and 
                    intuitive interface following a lean design method. My next step is to create low fidelity prototypes that bring the interactions 
                    to life and produce a minimum viable product through Axure for initial validation testing.

                <h3 class="projectNote">Prototyping</h3>
                <p>My first steps in prototyping include the creation of a site map to ensure that every feature of the interface is meaningful and allows
                     users to access essential features of the site. Through site map creation I am able to visualize the user flow and pin point 
                     redundancies and common drop off points that adversely affect the user experience.

                    Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch
                    (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),
                    dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes
                    termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize
                    or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques
                    ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs
                    without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives
                    from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In its most general form, the activities describing
                    music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies,
                    and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination
                    of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies
                    and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to
                    my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century
                    composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise, only
                    sound."[2] The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to
                    culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized
                    as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[3] early jazz in the
                    beginning of the 1900s[4] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.[5] There are many types of music, including
                    popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such
                    as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from
                    the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde
                    styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries. Music can be divided into
                    genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres (e.g., country blues and
                    pop country are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between
                    music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial.
                    For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal. Within
                    the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be
                    played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic
                    work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD
                    player, smartphone or as film score or TV show. In many cultures, music is an important part of people's
                    way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation
                    and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke
                    singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as
                    a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or singer.
                    The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters
                    and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians,
                    singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers), individuals
                    who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and sheet music and scores to customers.

                    the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including the arts. The word derives from Greek μουσική
                    (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired
                    literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics,
                    and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, the term "music" is
                    derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica "the art
                    of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish musica, Italian musica, Old High German
                    mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived from the "...Greek mousike (techne)
                    "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)).
                    Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term "music" refers to] any art in
                    which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."[6] As a form of art or entertainment
                    Jean-Gabriel Ferlan (fr) performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier Music
                    is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial
                    purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet
                    music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music
                    of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent
                    of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music
                    lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital
                    music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their favourite songs and take them
                    with them on a portable cassette player or MP3 player. Some music lovers create mix tapes of their favorite
                    songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and]
                    an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."[7]

                    Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch
                    (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),
                    dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes
                    termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize
                    or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques
                    ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs
                    without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives
                    from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In its most general form, the activities describing
                    music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies,

                    sound."[2] The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to
                    culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized
                    as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[3] early jazz in the
                    beginning of the 1900s[4] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.[5] There are many types of music, including
                    popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such
                    as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from
                    the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde
                    styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries. Music can be divided into
                    genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres (e.g., country blues and
                    pop country are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between
                    music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial.
                    For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal. Within
                    the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be
                    played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic
                    work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD
                    player, smartphone or as film score or TV show. In many cultures, music is an important part of people's
                    way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation
                    and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke
                    singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as
                    a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or singer.
                    The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters
                    and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians,
                    singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers), individuals
                    who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and sheet music and scores to customers.

                    the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including the arts. The word derives from Greek μουσική
                    (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired
                    literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics,
                    and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, the term "music" is
                    derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica "the art
                    of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish musica, Italian musica, Old High German
                    mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived from the "...Greek mousike (techne)
                    "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)).
                    Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term "music" refers to] any art in
                    which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."[6] As a form of art or entertainment
                    Jean-Gabriel Ferlan (fr) performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier Music
                    is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial
                    purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet
                    music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music
                    of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent
                    of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music
                    lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital
                    music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their favourite songs and take them
                    with them on a portable cassette player or MP3 player. Some music lovers create mix tapes of their favorite
                    songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and]
                    an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."[7]

                    Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch
                    (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),
                    dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes
                    termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize
                    or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques
                    ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs
                    without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives
                    from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In its most general form, the activities describing
                    music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies,
                    and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination
                    of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies
                    and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to
                    my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century
                    composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise, only
                    sound."[2] The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to
