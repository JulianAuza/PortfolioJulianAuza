                <p>Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of
                    music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter,
                    and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which
                    are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize,
                    de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and
                    vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal
                    pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.
                    The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In its most general form, the activities
                    describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes,
                    symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic
                    examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally
                    as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it
                    is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However,
                    20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no
                    noise, only sound."[2] The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary
                    according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music
                    have been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[3]
                    early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s[4] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.[5] There are many types of
                    music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies
                    and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical
                    music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played improvisational music such
                    as jazz, and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries.
                    Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres
                    (e.g., country blues and pop country are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines
                    and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and
                    occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard
                    rock and heavy metal. Within the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art or as
                    an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance,
                    heard live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened
                    to on a radio, MP3 player, CD player, smartphone or as film score or TV show. In many cultures, music
                    is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage
                    ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities
                    ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir.
                    People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional
                    musician or singer. The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces
                    (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band
                    and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound
                    engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and sheet music
                    and scores to customers. Contents [hide] 1 Etymology 2 As a form of art or entertainment 2.1 Composition

                    the nine Muses were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including the arts. The word derives
                    from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the goddesses
                    who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the
                    poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary,
                    the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique (12c.) and directly from
                    Latin musica "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish musica, Italian
                    musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived from the
                    "...Greek mousike (techne) "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from
                    Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term
                    "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."[6] As
                    a form of art or entertainment Jean-Gabriel Ferlan (fr) performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée
                    Saint-François Xavier Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure,
                    religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was
                    only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers
                    would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home
                    on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became
                    the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders
                    in the 1980s and digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their favourite
                    songs and take them with them on a portable cassette player or MP3 player. Some music lovers create mix
                    tapes of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription
                    for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."[7]
