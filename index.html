                        <p style="margin-top:10px;"> I am passionate about crafting seamless digital experiences. My background in UX has given me the
                            ability to solve problems efficiently through research and design. I have recently discovered
                            my affinity for development which inspired me to complete the full stack development programs
                            at Coding Dojo. I am currently looking forward to new opportunities that will allow me to learn
                            new skills and challenge my abilities.</p>

                <h3 class="projectNote">UI/UX Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I spoke with my client to discuss an idea for an eCommerce website that focused promoting Amazon products with 
                    a rebate incentive. The timeline for this project was very tight and as a person with little tech background the 
                    requirements for the project were very vague. The main goals of my client’s site was to gain the trust of users, 
                    convert, and also have returning users. My main concerns for this project was my inexperience 
                    with rebate based commerce and also the vague description of the project which would make it difficult to pinpoint 
                    the meaning of a successful design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to take on this project since it would be my opportunity to work with the client and to
                    build a list of requirements for the project. I would then need to apply my own skills from working in eCommerce 
                    and learn about building a trusting relationship with an interface of a site that will be completely foreign to a user. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="projectNote"> Research and Planning</h3>
                <p>I carried out a competitive and heuristic analysis to gain an understanding of the different mental models present in 
                   different types of users of eCommerce platforms. Going through different sites, I noticed that they all had their own 
                   efficient way of organizing their information tailored to their user's goals. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="projectNote">Persona Creation</h3>

                <p>To gather information regarding the mental model of the target users I carried out surveys and interviews that
                    uncover user's preferences, attitudes, and feelings towards certain features, events, and situations.
                    The surveys consisted of questions that rated the the user's reactions and attitudes towards certain
                    features and interactions. The interview questions consisted of open ended questions to dig deeper into
                    the users mental model and uncover potential areas for innovation. I used the information derived from
                    surveys and interviews to create three personas that embodied three main user goals that my design will
                    revolve around.</p><br>

                <p>My iterative design process starts with the creation a site map and user flows to ensure that all of the
                    features of the site are accessible through the appropriate navigation. of wire frames that I occasionally
                    test with my peers to ensure a cohesive and intuitive interface following a lean design method. My next
                    step is to create low fidelity prototypes that bring the interactions to life and produce a minimum viable
                    product for initial validation testing.

                <p style="display: inline-block;width: 50%;vertical-align: top;padding-right:20px;">My first steps in prototyping include the creation of a site map to ensure that every feature of the interface
                    is meaningful and allows users to access essential features of the site. Through site map creation I
                    am able to visualize the user flow and pin point common drop off points that adversely affect the user
                    experience. For the final unmoderated remote user testing I wanted to ensure that the interface was intuitive
                    and allowed users to complete their goals with minimal pain points and efficiency. I compiled a list
                    of tasks and follow up questions to ensure that the tasks were completed correctly. If the tasks were
                    completed correctly, there would be a specific code revealed that would allow me to ensure the predicted
                    path was taken by the user in order to complete the task.

                <h3 class="projectNote">Reflection</h3>
                <p>While the direction of this project was initially vague from the instruction of my client, I was able to
                    pin point certain features that would increase conversion on a site that would be completely new to the
                    user. The most important goal of this project is to create an experience that is familiar and one that
                    will encourage users to trust the site and convert. This project taught me the importance of working
                    with lean UX in mind since I had close deadline.Through completing this project I was able to better
                    understand the elements of flat UI and also work with creating my own scalable pixel perfect icons.​</p>

                    I worked in a team of four people creating a iPad based POS system that would provide the best experience for the user and
                    allow them to confidently and efficiently enter transactions. This extensive process incorporated the
                    various elements of user centered design such as user testing, competitive analysis, and heuristic analysis.

                <h3 class="projectNote">Research</h3>
                <p>Our first step was identifying key features that users needed to reach their main goals with our product.
                    I was responsible for conducting user interviews and surveys that helped us identify these features.
                    Then a card sorting exercise was conducted to better understand the user's informational mind set. My
                    group then conducted an A/B testing to track user's reactions and behaviours towards different visual
                    design aspects. In addition, my team conducted a competitive analysis in order to evaluate our products
                    functionality in comparison with current POS systems out on the market.

                <p>I worked on many aspects in the iterative design process including the selection of a muted color scheme
                    and the placement of app features. We collaborated and had multiple brainstorming sessions before creating
                    mock ups for us to defend our own ideas. After collaborating and meeting with our manager, we were able
                    to recieve the approval to create a high fidelity prototype with invision.

                    served as a model for our own. We noted the format of their user testing script and incorporated our
                    own ideas to make it more effective for our own case. Our team then went on to recruit target users as
                    well as fringe cases to test our prototype.

                <p> This experience has taught me a lot about working together in a group and the benefits of working in a collaborative
                    space. I learned an extensive amount of information about user experience design and aspects of user
                    interface design that increases affordability in a product. I know how to conduct user test to avoid
                    my own biases and truly uncover user needs. I was able to design solutions that helped users and the
                    business meet their goals.</p>

                    My team was assigned the task of creating a web app similar to "Stubhub". We had many things to consider because of the database
                    heavy nature of the web app. We first came up with features essential to the user experience which we
                    then narrowed down to an MVP that became our main focus. We developed several user stories from the MVP
                    list of features.

                            After listing requirements and identifying blockers I decided to started working on the Log In/Register user story since
                            it was at the very beginning of the experience. This user story also did not have any current
                            blockers that I would have needed my other team members to complete.

                            I started with building the user models and then validations. The validations, if not met, would display an error message
                            on the client side informing the user of missing or required fields. In addition, I also built
                            the models for the checkout process and also the logic behind adding and removing items to the
                            cart.

                    add-ons that would improve functionality of the MVP Features, and finally the orange post-its are the
                    features not necessary to the MVP but are optional.

                    Since design was not the main focus of the project. I took innitiative and added styling as I built out my user stories.
                    I appreciate the aesthetic material design which I incorporated onto the pages I built. I ran through
                    my color scheme with my group and they were very receptive of my ideas. I placed teal and variations
                    of white as the main color scheme and added a vibrant orange as a call to action button. I made sure
                    that the site was interactive and added hover states to clickable entities such as the tiles in the search
                    results.

                <h4 class="stack">M.E.A.N (MongoDB, Express, Angular 2, Node.js)</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My team worked on a project that is modeled after the pinterest social media site.I was in charge of putting together the
                    front end styling of this project and I wanted to challenge my front-end development skills by structuring
                    the client side to be as close to the pinterest website as possible using CSS functions. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p> The first step in planning was going through the pinterest site and identifying the interactions that would need to
                    be created to give our product the same look and feel of the pinterest website. After listing all of the features, my team 
                    then cut down the list to a shorter list essential to the MVP.
                </p>
                <p> Before starting any work on the project my team used post-it note planning to identify blockers and find the most effective
                    progression of work. We then each chose to take over several user stories that we would all build from database
                    to the client side. We then proceeded to prioritize features of the project using the MoSCoW method and build pieces
                    of the project that had the least number of blockers.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>My User Stories</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to working on the front end styling I was responsible for the board creation, exploring, and the profile page
                    user stories. I recognized that everyone on of my stories had a blocker that was dependent on the creation
                    of the user and also the pins created by said users. I communicated to my team that
                    I would initially work the front end styling until the models that I needed were created and I would
                    be able to grab pins to place into the boards.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Daily Workflow</h3>
                <p>
                    Each day my team conducted stand-ups where we talked about our progress into our sections of the project and also if we needed
                    any help from one another. We also had end of day meetings where we talked about the goals we had met and our expectations for 
                    the next day to stay on track with our deadline.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is a video showcasing the functionality of our app. I am currently working on deploying my project onto heroku. In the
                    video, I am going through the log-in process, board creation, adding pins to the board, and going through
                    the explore page where the pins are filtered according to the categories listed on the left of the screen.

                <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Positives</h4>
                <p>
                    The team worked very well with communication with the aid of daily stand ups that helped each of us gain perspective and an understanding of 
                    where our project was realistically heading. Our team was also able to do a lot of our own research with discovering solutions to problems that 
                    were not covered in our original MEAN stack documentation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Deltas</h4>
                <p>
                    There was not a very clear division of labor since the MEAN stack was more complicated than we initially had planned. Our team ran into
                    multiple errors that required our instructors assistance in order to resolve the problem. In the middle of our project, the team pushed their 
                    work on to github which caused the web to crash in each of our machines. We could not figure out the issue until an instructor got involved and
                    identified that the dist file was not being ignored in our git repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were also multiple times where my work depended on my team mate's work where they had taken longer to complete where I stepped in and
                    completed their part for them. I also felt that we could have been more efficient in our planning where we would not have needed to work on essential
                    features till the last minute before our project was being presented.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Exploration Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The explore page was a challenge because of the different calls needed to filter through the list of pin object in the database. My initial
                    approach was to use different calls that would return a list of pins dependent on the conditional statements of the 
                    method. I was able to pull pins from the database using an HTTP request and then traversed through the data using an ng for in loop. As 
                    for as styling I was able to build a display using CSS columns to mimic the display on pinterest. Each pin has the functionality of being added 
                    onto a board. I then needed to create a way to filter through the pins. Instead of a completely new http request I wrote html code 
                    that reloaded each component with an ng conditional statement to only display pins related to the category being highlighted.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Adding Pins to Boards</h4>
                <p>
                    I had to build the functionality of being able to add pins to the user created boards. My initial approach was to build a light box 
                    interaction using javascript but this was not possible since I had limited time and the way angular works is that the light box would have had to 
                    be a completely new component all together. With limited time I looked through my resources and came across documentation on modals. I was able 
                    to build a modal with an ID tag that is linked to an anchor tag. I then added css styling in order to darken the background to simulate a light 
                    box interaction. I was then faced with the challenge of building interactions in the "light box" without nesting the anchor tags. Each 
                    interaction needed to be an input which sent information to the server and carried out the logic that added the pin into the board.

                <h4 class="stack">C# | ASP.NET</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My team worked on a project modeled after match.com which is a popular dating site. My team decided to go the 
                    creative route and tackle the problem from a different angle. We decided to build a product called "Who's A Good Dog" (WAG Dog) for the niche dog
                    owners that create social media profiles for their dogs. The challenge of converting the preferences of human 
                    users on match.com to the dog preferences in WAG dog was appealing and we enjoyed ourselves creating this app.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p> The first stages of app development involved an analysis of the match.com site and uncovering the features needed 
                    for users to achieve their goals. The team collectively went into match.com, created profiles, and then compared
                    notes on different functionalities of the site. As a team we were able to list all of the features on a white board
                    and point out the essential features for our MVP. Keeping the MVP in mind, we were able to convert the features into
                    full user stories that represented a user task that each of us would be building from database all the way to the client-facing
                    interface. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>My User Stories</h3>
                <p>
                   My section of the project included developing the view of your own and other's profiles, messaging and sending winks, viewing and
                   filtering results, and finally, I was responsible for the design and development of the navigation. In order to effectively carry out
                   my tasks, I planned out a journey map which consisted of multiple touch points the user would come accross while using
                   our app. By doing so, I was able to identify blockers in my work flow which then led me to work on the navigation first since this task
                   had no dependency on any other feature of the site.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Building Models</h3>
                <div style="width:875px;margin:auto;text-align:center;">
                        <img class="border" src="assets/wagDog/models.jpg" style="width:100%">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My team recognized that the relationships between preferences and the users would be very complicated which is what led us to carefully
                    plan out our models before hand. We were able to analyze different join tables necessary for the site's functionality which allowed us to
                    focus on our own tasks once our data base was constructed. Towards the end of the project my team member identified a crucial issue with the models but
                    we were quickly able to resolve the problem through effective planning and communication.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Project Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    We conducted daily stand-ups in order for us to maintain an open line of communication. While building on our own sections of the app
                    , we all realized that a lot of our user stories had touch points that were dependent on one another's work. For example, I would not be able to 
                    work on the sending and recieving of messages until the user entities were created. Our group decided to hold three meetings a day which would allow us to keep track of 
                    each other's progress. This proved very useful since it allowed us to align our work flows with one another which allowed us to be more productive and 
                    also keep our merge-conflicts to a minimum. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Styling</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my team members decided to build a style guide with basic functions and styles that we as a team decided to follow. I was able to experience
                    developing visual elements that were not part of my own vision. I found that following a style guide allowed me to be more objective in the development 
                    of my own featues. While I was not the main stylist of the site I was able to assist by applying my CSS skills to the search pages, search filtering, messaging,
                    and the profile pages.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>App Demo</h3>
                <p>
                   I have included a walkthrough of our app in a video below since the deployment through heroku is still in progress. I am walking through the log in / registration process
                   viewing matches, sorting, and sending messages. Our users are also able to post pictures, update their profile information, and block other users.

                <h4 class="stack">Positives</h4>
                <p>
                    My team did a great job of effective planning where we only had to re structure our models a few times. With all of the different relationships 
                    required from the database we were all diligent in our planning and labeled foreign keys efficiently which led to a smooth integreation of our
                    pieces. Eventhough we needed to overlap and complete each other's work we were able to do so efficiently through effective and constant communication.

                    Since this is our first strongly typed language, my group did an excellent job maintaining the integrity of our app by synchronized git pushing and also 
                    conflict management. We managed to resolve each of our issues independently and make good use of our time.

                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Deltas</h4>
                <p>
                    With this project I decided to not take on the breadth of the styling work which was assigned to my other two team members but towards the end of the 
                    project the styling was passed on to me. I felt that as a designer I should have communicated my process to them more efficiently so that it would have been
                    easier to build a consistent style guide. I found myself creating multple classes to manipulate certain elements that should have been unified.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Filtering Users</h4>
                <p>
                    Since I was in charge of the display of all users on the home page, I took on the interaction of ebing able to filter users. I initally reloaded the page with each
                    request. I felt that this was not a smooth interaction for the user so I built separate HTML pages for each query that would display using jQuery.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="stack">Messaging/h4>
                <p>
                    My messaging interaction came as a struggle since I am not the best with databases. I needed to create a table for messages which then needed to be pulled
