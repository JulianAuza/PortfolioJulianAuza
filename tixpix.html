                    <h4 class="stack">Python/Django</h4>
                    <p>
                        My team was assigned the task of creating a web app similar to "Stubhub". We had many things to consider because of the database
                        heavy nature of the web app. We first came up with features essential to the user experience which we
                        then narrowed down to an MVP that became our main focus. We developed several user stories from the MVP
                        list of features.

                    <h3>My User Stories</h3>
                    <p>For this project I was responsible for the Login/Signup, Checkout, and Shopping Cart touch points. Before
                        starting any of the coding I wrote out user journey maps that would allow me to identify any blockers
                        which would give me the most efficient work-flow for my user stories.
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                After listing requirements and identifying blockers I decided to started working on the Log In/Register user story since
                                it was at the very beginning of the experience. This user story also did not have any current
                                blockers that I would have needed my other team members to complete.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                I started with building the user models and then validations. The validations, if not met, would display an error message
                                on the client side informing the user of missing or required fields. In addition, I also built
                                the models for the checkout process and also the logic behind adding and removing items to the
                                cart.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <h3>Post-it Note Planning</h3>
                    <div style="width:875px;margin:auto;text-align:center;">
                        <img class="border" src="assets/TixPIx/workFlow.png" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        My Team also utilized post-it notes to to plan out the most effective work flow. We were able to visualize our blockers and
                        work on our sections of the project as the blockers were completed. We were also able to prioritize features
                        as part of the MVP. Features essential to the MVP are on the blue post-its, the yellow post-its represent
                        add-ons that would improve functionality of the MVP Features, and finally the orange post-its are the
                        features not necessary to the MVP but are optional.

                        Since design was not the main focus of the project. I took innitiative and added styling as I built out my user stories.
                        I appreciate the aesthetic material design which I incorporated onto the pages I built. I ran through
                        my color scheme with my group and they were very receptive of my ideas. I placed teal and variations
                        of white as the main color scheme and added a vibrant orange as a call to action button. I made sure
                        that the site was interactive and added hover states to clickable entities such as the tiles in the search
                        results.
