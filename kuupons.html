            <h3 class="projectNote">UI/UX Design</h3>
            <p>
                I spoke with my client to discuss an idea for an eCommerce website that focused promoting Amazon products with a rebate incentive.
                The timeline for this project was very tight and as a person with little tech background the requirements
                for the project were very vague. The main goals of my client’s site was to gain the trust of users, convert,
                and also have returning users. My main concerns for this project was my inexperience with rebate based commerce
                and also the vague description of the project which would make it difficult to pinpoint the meaning of a
                successful design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to take on this project since it would be my opportunity to work with the client and to build a list of requirements
                for the project. I would then need to apply my own skills from working in eCommerce and learn about building
                a trusting relationship with an interface of a site that will be completely foreign to a user.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="projectNote"> Research and Planning</h3>
            <p>I carried out a competitive and heuristic analysis to gain an understanding of the different mental models present
                in different types of users of eCommerce platforms. Going through different sites, I noticed that they all
                had their own efficient way of organizing their information tailored to their user's goals.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="projectNote">Persona Creation</h3>

            <p>To gather information regarding the mental model of the target users I carried out surveys and interviews that
                uncover user's preferences, attitudes, and feelings towards certain features, events, and situations. The
                surveys consisted of questions that rated the the user's reactions and attitudes towards certain features
                and interactions. The interview questions consisted of open ended questions to dig deeper into the users
                mental model and uncover potential areas for innovation. I used the information derived from surveys and
                interviews to create three personas that embodied three main user goals that my design will revolve around.</p>

            <p>My iterative design process starts with the creation a site map and user flows to ensure that all of the features
                of the site are accessible through the appropriate navigation. of wire frames that I occasionally test with
                my peers to ensure a cohesive and intuitive interface following a lean design method. My next step is to
                create low fidelity prototypes that bring the interactions to life and produce a minimum viable product for
                initial validation testing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="projectNote">Prototyping</h3>
            <p style="display: inline-block;width: 50%;vertical-align: top;padding-right:20px;">My first steps in prototyping include the creation of a site map to ensure that every feature of the interface
                is meaningful and allows users to access essential features of the site. Through site map creation I am able
                to visualize the user flow and pin point common drop off points that adversely affect the user experience. For
                the final unmoderated remote user testing I wanted to ensure that the interface was intuitive and allowed
                users to complete their goals with minimal pain points and efficiency. I compiled a list of tasks and follow
                up questions to ensure that the tasks were completed correctly. If the tasks were completed correctly, there
                would be a specific code revealed that would allow me to ensure the predicted path was taken by the user
                in order to complete the task.

            <h3 class="projectNote">Reflection</h3>
            <p>While the direction of this project was initially vague from the instruction of my client, I was able to pin
                point certain features that would increase conversion on a site that would be completely new to the user.
                The most important goal of this project is to create an experience that is familiar and one that will encourage
                users to trust the site and convert. This project taught me the importance of working with lean UX in mind
                since I had close deadline.Through completing this project I was able to better understand the elements of
                flat UI and also work with creating my own scalable pixel perfect icons.​</p>
