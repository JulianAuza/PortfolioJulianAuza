                    <h4 class="stack">M.E.A.N (MongoDB, Express, Angular 2, Node.js)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My team worked on a project that is modeled after the pinterest social media site. I was in charge of putting together the
                        front end styling of this project and I wanted to challenge my front-end development skills by structuring
                        the client side to be as close to the pinterest website as possible using CSS functions. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p> The first step in planning was going through the pinterest site and identifying the interactions that would need to
                        be created to give our product the same look and feel of the pinterest website. After listing all of the features, my team 
                        then cut down the list to a shorter list essential to the MVP.
                    </p>
                    <p> Before starting any work on the project my team used post-it note planning to identify blockers and find the most effective
                        progression of work. We then each chose to take over several user stories that we would all build from database
                        to the client side. We then proceeded to prioritize features of the project using the MoSCoW method and build pieces
                        of the project that had the least number of blockers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
    
                    <h3>My User Stories</h3>
                    <p>
                        In addition to working on the front end styling I was responsible for the board creation, exploring, and the profile page
                        user stories. I recognized that everyone on of my stories had a blocker that was dependent on the creation
                        of the user and also the pins created by said users. I communicated to my team that
                        I would initially work the front end styling until the models that I needed were created and I would
                        be able to grab pins to place into the boards.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Daily Workflow</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each day my team conducted stand-ups where we talked about our progress into our sections of the project and also if we needed
                        any help from one another. We also had end of day meetings where we talked about the goals we had met and our expectations for 
                        the next day to stay on track with our deadline.
                    </p>
                    <br>
    
                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>
                        Below is a video showcasing the functionality of our app. I am currently working on deploying my project onto heroku. In the
                        video, I am going through the log-in process, board creation, adding pins to the board, and going through
                        the explore page where the pins are filtered according to the categories listed on the left of the screen.

                    <h4 class="stack">Positives</h4>
                    <p>
                        The team worked very well with communication with the aid of daily stand ups that helped each of us gain perspective and an understanding of 
                        where our project was realistically heading. Our team was also able to do a lot of our own research with discovering solutions to problems that 
                        were not covered in our original MEAN stack documentation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="stack">Deltas</h4>
                    <p>
                        There was not a very clear division of labor since the MEAN stack was more complicated than we initially had planned. Our team ran into
                        multiple errors that required our instructors assistance in order to resolve the problem. In the middle of our project, the team pushed their 
                        work on to github which caused the web to crash in each of our machines. We could not figure out the issue until an instructor got involved and
                        identified that the dist file was not being ignored in our git repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were also multiple times where my work depended on my team mate's work where they had taken longer to complete where I stepped in and
                        completed their part for them. I also felt that we could have been more efficient in our planning where we would not have needed to work on essential
                        features till the last minute before our project was being presented.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="stack">Exploration Page</h4>
                    <p>
                        The explore page was a challenge because of the different calls needed to filter through the list of pin object in the database. My initial
                        approach was to use different calls that would return a list of pins dependent on the conditional statements of the 
                        method. I was able to pull pins from the database using an HTTP request and then traversed through the data using an ng for in loop. As 
                        for as styling I was able to build a display using CSS columns to mimic the display on pinterest. Each pin has the functionality of being added 
                        onto a board. I then needed to create a way to filter through the pins. Instead of a completely new http request I wrote html code 
                        that reloaded each component with an ng conditional statement to only display pins related to the category being highlighted.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="stack">Adding Pins to Boards</h4>
                    <p>
                        I had to build the functionality of being able to add pins to the user created boards. My initial approach was to build a light box 
                        interaction using javascript but this was not possible since I had limited time and the way angular works is that the light box would have had to 
                        be a completely new component all together. With limited time I looked through my resources and came across documentation on modals. I was able 
                        to build a modal with an ID tag that is linked to an anchor tag. I then added css styling in order to darken the background to simulate a light 
                        box interaction. I was then faced with the challenge of building interactions in the "light box" without nesting the anchor tags. Each 
                        interaction needed to be an input which sent information to the server and carried out the logic that added the pin into the board.
