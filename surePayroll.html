            <h3 class="projectNote">Earnings and Deductions Entry</h3>
            <p>Overview: </p>
            <p>
                SurePayroll launched an online onboarding tool that allowed users to fill out their own information to reduce 
                the time spent communicating with our sales team and give users more control over their enrollment experience. 
                The next step in this project is to give users the ability to add their own earnings and deductions which is crucial
                for our users to run their payroll correctly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Role: </p>
            <p>
                User Experience Design <br>
                User Research<br>
                UI Development
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Problem: </p>
            <p>
                The current experience users needed to go through in order to add earnings and deductions is to call our sales team
                which is a large pain point and forces users to go through multiple steps in order to complete their task.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Design process: </p>
            <p>
                After I learned as much about the issue as I could I decided to meet with sales which is the current way that users are
                 having their earnings and deductions entered in. I was able to learn about the amount of guidance and instructional 
                 material that sales needed to give to the user in order for the users to understand the importance of adding their 
                 earnings and deductions. Anecdotal evidence from sales points at the lack of awareness and information available about 
                 earnings and deductions presented to the user. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Research: </p>
            <p>
                I conducted user interviews in order to gain attitudinal feedback towards adding their earnings and deductions on the 
                onboarding interface. To get the best users possible I targeted new users who recently completed the enrollment process 
                and have successfully converted into clients. In order to cover any fringe cases I also reached out to users that went 
                through the enrollment process but ultimately did not convert.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Findings: </p>
            <p>
                80% of users did not need to add additional earnings during their process.<br>
                50% of users did not know why they needed to add earnings and deductions during enrollment. <br>
                There are some cases where adding earnings and deductions are mandatory.<br>

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Wireframing: </p>
            <p>
                My main goal for this tool was to be as easy and as straightforward as possible. 

                This tool also needed to be hidden from those who did not need it but accessible to those users who did need to add earnings and deductions.
            </p>

            <img class="border" src="assets/surePayroll/wireFrame2.png" style="height:311px;display:inline-block;margin:auto;">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Validation: </p>
            <p>
                I recruited 8 new SureParyoll users that had varying industries. 4 were new businesses less than 1 year. 4 were experienced business owners1 year or more. 

                The users were placed in front of the tool and running the Wireframe through Axure so that users would feel that they were truly experiencing adding earnings and deductions. A list of tasks was handed to the user and they were encouraged to think out loud as they completed each task.

                By observing their interactions with the new interface the feature proved to be a viable alternative to calling in and having manually adding earnings and deductions. 

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Development:  </p>
            <p>
                I gave the backend dev team a high fidelity mockup with detailed explanation of functionality.
                I built the front end artifacts using HTML, CSS, and JS on an Angular 6 framework. My work was then handed off to the backend team to implement functionality. I conducted a walk through in our staging environment before approving the project for a release.
                
                I decided to break apart the two experiences (Reviewing included earnings and selecting additional earnings). I decided this so that users that did not need to select additional earnings did not have to interact with the adding tool.

            <h3 class="projectNote">Reflection</h3>
            <p>
               Collaboration and communication to be very important aspects of any successful project. I was able to gather more information a lot faster using experts in my team instead of researching interactions on my own. 
                Communication was also very important in the handoff process. In addition to writing out careful requirements, I conducted demos where I presented interactions and backend developers were able to ask clarifying questions.
