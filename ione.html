            <p>
                The best selling categories of products on the e-commerce platform included hair products and hair care tools. Because of 
                this, the turnover of our other products, such as makeup and skincare, suffered and some of the products reached their 
                shelf lives which then needed to be returned to the vendor. The goal of this project was to increase the inventory turn 
                over of the other products being sold on the site.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Research:</p>
            <p>
                Having been in business for over ten years I hypothesized that the make up and skin 
                care products were outdated and low quality which led me to conduct a competitive 
                analysis on competing skin care and make up brands on other websites. Through this process I 
                uncovered a pattern in each of the sitesÂ’s menus which was also prevalent in our 
                own site which was the location and the categorization of the make up and skincare 
                products. While our most popular products were being displayed on the left side of 
                the menu, the skincare and makeup products were grouped together under sundries 
                or miscellaneous which confuses users.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Card Sorting:</p>
            <p>
                In order to uncover the most effective category names, I conducted a card sorting exercise
                where I recruited our most active customers and instructed them to place products in categories 
                and give the categories their own names. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <img class="border" src="assets/Ione/card-sorting.png" style="width:550px;display:block;margin:auto;">
            <br>
            <p>Design:</p>
            <p>
                Using the dendorogram created through the card sorting process, I created menu tabs 
                that would reveal item categories that nested accurate product types within them. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <img class="border" src="assets/Ione/category.png" style="width:550px;display:block;margin:auto;">
            <br>
            <p>Result:</p>
            <p>
                The sales numbers in the quarter after the re-design was implemented showed an increase of 22%
                in makeup and skincare sales. While this is an impressive number it is hard to pinpoint whether or 
                not this was correlation or causation since our social media affiliate program was implemented 
                during this quarter as well. We did gain positive feedback on the navigation of our site through
                our biz-rate survey program. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3 class="projectNote">E-mail Re-design</h3>
            <p>
                The email marketing sent out to users on our mailing list was in the format of a catalog which 
                displayed over 30 products which showed the most popular and new products in no order. This lay out
                returned a 7-8% click through rate which this project aims to improve.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Ideation:</p>
            <p>
                After Looking through other e-commerce marketing outreach material and best practices I 
                chose to create a layout that mixed content in addition to presenting products to our users. 
                The limiting of products presented allows users to look through each category while the 
                content keeps the users engaged through the page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Development:</p>
            <p> Using dreamweaver and bootstrap I was able to pull a template from our archives which I used as a boiler plate to build the HTML mark up and styling</p>
            <br>
            <img class="border" src="assets/Ione/email-template.png" style="width:550px;display:block;margin:auto;">
            <br>
            <p>Result:</p>
            <p>Our email click-through rate increased from 10% to 25% which lead to an increase in sales of 
                products featured in the email. I learned that more content allows users to engage with the 
                email instead of just looking through what products were being discounted.
            </p>

            <h3 class="projectNote">Landing Page Design</h3>
            <p> Through the use of google analytics and adwords I was given the responsibilty of reducing ppc 
                and increasing conversion on our site. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Research:</p>
            <p>I took the time to look into competitor sites and also look into best practices in page layout and also 
                the use of keywords on the Google analytics platform which gave me onsite on best practices to follow also 
                gave my team the opportunity to conduct AB testing on our designs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Development:</p>
            <p>Using our CMS system , HTML, and CSS  I was able to customize a product page according 
                to the keywords related to the searches. I ensured that the users were landing on a page 
                with complete transparency to reduce bounce back rate and increase conversion. I was able
                conduct AB testing through Google analytics and uncover designs that were most successful.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img class="border" src="assets/Ione/landing-page.png" style="width:550px;display:block;margin:auto;">
            <br>
            <p>Result:</p>
            <p>Through this testing and iteration process I was able to significantly reduce ppc cost of multiple
                Ad campaigns that used higher priced key words.
            </p>
