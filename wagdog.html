                    <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
                    <h4 class="stack">C# | ASP.NET</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My team worked on a project modeled after match.com which is a popular dating site. My team decided to go the 
                        creative route and tackle the problem from a different angle. We decided to build a product called "Who's A Good Dog" (WAG Dog) for the niche dog
                        owners that create social media profiles for their dogs. The challenge of converting the preferences of human 
                        users on match.com to the dog preferences in WAG dog was appealing and we enjoyed ourselves creating this app.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p> The first stages of app development involved an analysis of the match.com site and uncovering the features needed 
                        for users to achieve their goals. The team collectively went into match.com, created profiles, and then compared
                        notes on different functionalities of the site. As a team we were able to list all of the features on a white board
                        and point out the essential features for our MVP. Keeping the MVP in mind, we were able to convert the features into
                        full user stories that represented a user task that each of us would be building from database all the way to the client-facing
                        interface. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
    
                    <h3>My User Stories</h3>
                    <p>
                       My section of the project included developing the view of your own and other's profiles, messaging and sending winks, viewing and
                       filtering results, and finally, I was responsible for the design and development of the navigation. In order to effectively carry out
                       my tasks, I planned out a journey map which consisted of multiple touch points the user would come accross while using
                       our app. By doing so, I was able to identify blockers in my work flow which then led me to work on the navigation first since this task
                       had no dependency on any other feature of the site.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Building Models</h3>
                    <div style="width:875px;margin:auto;text-align:center;">
                            <img class="border" src="assets/wagDog/models.jpg" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My team recognized that the relationships between preferences and the users would be very complicated which is what led us to carefully
                        plan out our models before hand. We were able to analyze different join tables necessary for the site's functionality which allowed us to
                        focus on our own tasks once our data base was constructed. Towards the end of the project my team member identified a crucial issue with the models but
                        we were quickly able to resolve the problem through effective planning and communication.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Project Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted daily stand-ups in order for us to maintain an open line of communication. While building on our own sections of the app
                        , we all realized that a lot of our user stories had touch points that were dependent on one another's work. For example, I would not be able to 
                        work on the sending and recieving of messages until the user entities were created. Our group decided to hold three meetings a day which would allow us to keep track of 
                        each other's progress. This proved very useful since it allowed us to align our work flows with one another which allowed us to be more productive and 
                        also keep our merge-conflicts to a minimum. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Styling</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my team members decided to build a style guide with basic functions and styles that we as a team decided to follow. I was able to experience
                        developing visual elements that were not part of my own vision. I found that following a style guide allowed me to be more objective in the development 
                        of my own featues. While I was not the main stylist of the site I was able to assist by applying my CSS skills to the search pages, search filtering, messaging,
                        and the profile pages.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>App Demo</h3>
                    <p>
                       I have included a walkthrough of our app in a video below since the deployment through heroku is still in progress. I am walking through the log in / registration process
                       viewing matches, sorting, and sending messages. Our users are also able to post pictures, update their profile information, and block other users.
                    </p>

                        </form>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="stack">Positives</h4>
                    <p>
                        My team did a great job of effective planning where we only had to re structure our models a few times. With all of the different relationships 
                        required from the database we were all diligent in our planning and labeled foreign keys efficiently which led to a smooth integreation of our
                        pieces. Eventhough we needed to overlap and complete each other's work we were able to do so efficiently through effective and constant communication.
    
                        Since this is our first strongly typed language, my group did an excellent job maintaining the integrity of our app by synchronized git pushing and also 
                        conflict management. We managed to resolve each of our issues independently and make good use of our time.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="stack">Deltas</h4>
                    <p>
                        With this project I decided to not take on the breadth of the styling work which was assigned to my other two team members but towards the end of the 
                        project the styling was passed on to me. I felt that as a designer I should have communicated my process to them more efficiently so that it would have been
                        easier to build a consistent style guide. I found myself creating multple classes to manipulate certain elements that should have been unified.

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="stack">Filtering Users</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since I was in charge of the display of all users on the home page, I took on the interaction of ebing able to filter users. I initally reloaded the page with each
                        request. I felt that this was not a smooth interaction for the user so I built separate HTML pages for each query that would display using jQuery.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="stack">Messaging</h4>
                    <p>
                        My messaging interaction came as a struggle since I am not the best with databases. I needed to create a table for messages which then needed to be pulled 
                        into the client side while being able to view the message and the sender. I feel that I could have been more efficient in my code in reducing the amount of nested 
                        loops in order to achieve the end result. I was able to pull all of the messages on to the client and place a conditional that displayed only the messages that matched 
                        the reciever ID with the current user. I would have been able create a more efficient process by storing the current user ID in the server and place this logic in the Http 
                        request instead of C# code placed in the html.
