        <p>
            I was the main designer for this project ideating and validating early design concepts with the goal of
            attracting new users per month. I conducted multiple types of research including user interviews and
            usability testing to gather feedback and pivot in design direction.

                        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                        <p>The initial design for this keyboard was not intuititve and I felt that the best way for this design to be scalable was for it to be responsive
                            since the terminal application can be places portrait or horizontal mode.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Introducing a New Style</h3>
                        <p>We wanted our users to see a color story they could trust.

            <p>
                I conducted user testing in order to gain general feedback on our terminal application and also the
                physical construction of the
                terminal. I collected feedback and presented findings so that my team could implemented any changes that
                were needed. My team used
                screen recording and user surveys in order to better analyze the pain points users came across.

            <h3 class="projectNote">Dashboard Application</h3>
            <br>

            <p>
                I participated in storyboarding to map out a comprehensive user journey so that we could anticipate
                features needed by each
                of our clients. We were able to collect information from our sales and marketing team which we then used
                to build our product
                to fit our clientâ€™s needs in addition to building a usable product.

            <h3 class="projectNote">Mobile Application</h3>
            <p>
                I created ideal work flows that the user would go through in the onboarding experience to convert users
                as quickly as possible. the main user goal was to
                enroll their information and get started with Keyo in a seamless fashion. One of the pain points I had
                to navigate around was the multi-factor autherntication
                that required users to enter a code for validation.

            <p>
                Working in a startup environment has been very rewarding and has taught me so many things especially
                about the importance of
                communication in a tight knit team. I was able to pick up the skills and endurance needed to become a
                crucial part of an
                organization. I am only able to share general details of the projects I've participated in due to
                privacy policies. Please contact me
                if you have any specific questions regarding my process.
