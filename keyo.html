                I was responsible for updating all of the UI assets and elements on the terminal so that it would align with our new branding 
                standards using Vue.js. I also participated in the creation of a style guide that was used in the scss files in order to keep 
                our classes consistent and efficient. The new styling allowed me to write consistent code using repeating classes. Through this 
                process I was also able to eliminate some technical debt and build new UI elements to be responsive.

            <p>
                I conducted user testing in order to gain general feedback on our terminal application and also the physical construction of the 
                terminal. I collected feedback and presented findings so that my team could implemented any changes that were needed. My team used 
                screen recording and user surveys in order to better analyze the pain points users came across.

            <h3 class="projectNote">Dashboard Application</h3>
            <p>Development: </p>
            <p>
                Similar to my role in the terminal application, I was responsible for updating the current UI to align with our new branding 
                standards. This interface was written in PHP | laravel which I had to learn quickly in order to meet the expectations of our 
                investors. I was also in charge of re-factoring the current CSS files into Scss which organized our styling library.

            <p>UX: </p>
            <p>
                I participated in storyboarding to map out a comprehensive user journey so that we could anticipate features needed by each 
                of our clients. We were able to collect information from our sales and marketing team which we then used to build our product 
                to fit our clientâ€™s needs in addition to building a usable product.

            <p>
                Working in a startup environment has been very rewarding and has taught me so many things especially about the importance of 
                communication in a tight knit team. I was able to pick up the skills and endurance needed to become a crucial part of an 
                organization. I am only able to share general details of the projects I've participated in due to privacy policies. Please contact me 
                if you have any specific questions regarding my process.
